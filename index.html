                <h2>What makes our <br>heart <span class="text">beat</span></h2>
                <br>

                <p>Like most ideas, the entire concept of Vently was not fully formed when we started off in Port Harcourt.<br><br> The initial plan was to build was a platform that connected event attendees to each other. but we discovered it could be way
                    more than that. Now we're building a platform that let's you interact more in a live or physical event and also an opportunity to get paid while doing it. Whether you're an attendee, event organizer, or event vendor - we're extending
                    an invitation to you to be part of our amazing journey. </p>

                    with vendors, provide concise analytics and any interactions you may need to connect better with your audience from when you hit publish.</p><br><br>
